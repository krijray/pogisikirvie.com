            <h1>Why <span>Zild Benitez</span> is my favorite artist</h1>
            <p>I've been a big fan of Zild since 2018. I wasn't very much of a big fan of OPM, but ever since I listened to their band "IV of Spades", I've been a big fan of OPM music till this day. He was a bassist in their band and what I really loved about their music is that, they revived the 90s style funk groove music. Their songs, Hey Barbara and Where Have You Been my Disco is an example. But then their band went on hiatus and never came back. I'm still hoping for a reunion though but I really hope it would happen (As a die hard IVOS fan). But all throughout Zild's solo career, he got to explore many different music genres. And that's what made me idolize him more. Each album he makes shows that he never dissapoints his fans. His Album Medisina truly struck me with his music. Despite years passing by, Zild being my favorite artist never changed. With the chances of OPM rising in this time, I'm thanking Zild and IV of Spades for introducing me into this. </p>
